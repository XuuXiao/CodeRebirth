Finally got the new computer working, after 3 years, took a bit, but we can finally document on a permanent source, something that can last longer. So this is where me(Dr. Steve Valentine), Dr. Lynn Mellor, Dr. Keith Dillon, and Dr. George Stuart can log our research.

While testing on Rapax-Folium, we discovered something interesting, the Rapax-Folium classified as RF-09, RF-09 appears to be around 70 years of age, heavily expanding the age range of Rapax-Folium, it’s covered in foliage it produces itself, and it seems to be a lot more resilient then most Rapax-Folium. We are going to preform tests on RF-09, to see the limitations and strengths it has, harsh conditions such as direct sunlight, which is dangerously harmful to Rapax-Folium, Radiation exposure, burn test, the things that a normal Rapax-Folium wouldn’t be able to withstand.

Testing RF-09 abilities and resistance has gone better then expected, getting the Rapax-Folium to cooperate however was quite the challenge. RF-09 showed great aggression when forced to move from it’s cell into the testing chamber, resulting in Dr. Mellor to be injured, and special forces brought in to assist in bringing the entity to it’s chamber. None the less, we got tests done, and RF-09 back in it’s original chamber.

Few days after testing, we were attacked by a group of Brackens, maybe 5 or so? They all came out of seemingly nowhere, took out the lights and most of the power, it’s very interesting because Brackens aren’t social entities, so it’s very weird why they would group up, I say RF-09 has something to do with it, I’ll have to keep a closer eye on it.
